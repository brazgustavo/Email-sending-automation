# Email-sending-automation
The goal of this project is to send emails to suppliers of items that are impacting the stock of NOK items. This code reads a set of Excel files, filters the items of interest, and sends personalized emails to each supplier asking them to show the destination of the parts, otherwise we will act according to the company's policy.
